[cmft](https://github.com/dariomanesku/cmft) - cubemap filtering tool
=====================================================================

Cross-platform open-source command-line cubemap filtering tool.

It reaches very fast processing speeds by utilizing both multi-core CPU and OpenCL GPU at the same time! (check [perfomance charts](https://github.com/dariomanesku/cmft#performance))

- Supported input/output formats: \*.dds, \*.ktx, \*.hdr, \*.tga.
- Supported input/output types: cubemap, cube cross, latlong, face list, horizontal and vertical strip.

Remark !
--------

- If you are running OpenCL procesing on the same GPU that it connected to your monitor you may experience the following problem: when you are processing big cubemaps (~1024 face size) with small 'glossScale' parameter (<7 for example), OpenCL kernels may take a long time to execute and that may cause the operative system to step in and kill the display/gpu driver in the middle of processing! To avoid this you can:
    - Use smaller input and ouput sizes ('srcFaceSize' and 'dstFaceSize').
    - Choose a bigger 'glossScale' parameter.
    - Use a workaround on Windows: increase the TdrDelay or modify the TdrLevel in the registry and restart the machine. More details here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff569918%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
    - Run cmft on a faster GPU.
    - Run cmft on a GPU that is not connected to the monitor.
    - Run cmft only on CPU only.

This problem has been carefully tackled: cmft now does tile processing and is optimized for fast execution so this show rarely happen again! However, if it does, please open an issue and tell me about your case.


Building
--------

	git clone git://github.com/dariomanesku/cmft.git
	cd cmft
	make

- After calling `make`, *\_projects* folder will be created with all supported project files. Deleting *\_projects* folder is safe at any time.<br \>
- All compiler generated files will be in *\_build* folder. Again, deleting *\_build* folder is safe at any time.<br \>

### Windows

- Visual Studio solutions can be found in *\_projects/vs20XX/*.<br \>

### Linux

- Makefile can be found in *\_projects/gmake-linux-gcc/*.<br \>
- Project can be build from the root directory by running `make linux-gcc-release64` (or similar).<br \>

### OS X

- XCode
  - XCode solution can be found in *\_projects/xcode4/*.<br \>
  - XCode project generated by genie contains only one scheme with 4 build configurations (debug/release 32/64bit). Select desired build configuration manually and/or setup schemes manually as desired.<br \>
  - Also you will probably have to manually specify runtime directory (it is not picking it from genie for some reason). You can do this by going to "*Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme... -> Run cmftDebug -> Options -> Working Directory (Use custom working directory)*" and specifying *runtime/* directory from cmft root folder.<br \>
- Makefile
  - Makefile can be found in *\_projects/gmake-osx-gcc/*.<br \>
  - Project can be build from the root directory by running `make osx-gcc-release64` (or similar).<br \>
  <br \>
- Remember to edit *runtime/cmft_osx.sh* accordingly in regard to the build system you are using.<br \>

### Other
- Also other compilation options may be available, have a look inside *\_projects* directory.<br \>
- File *config.mk* is used for setting environment variables for different compilers.<br \>
- Additional build configurations will be available in the future. If one is there and not described here in this document, it is probably not yet set up properly and may not work out-of-the-box as expected without some care.<br \>

### Known issues
- Linux GCC build works but processing on CPU is noticeably slower comparing to Windows build (haven't yet figured out why). OpenCL runs fine.
- PVRTexTool is not properly opening mipmapped \*.ktx files from cmft. This appears to be the problem with the current version of PVRTexTool. Has to be further investigated.


Performance
-----------

cmft was compared with the popular CubeMapGen tool for processing performance.<br \>
Test machine: Intel i5-3570 @ 3.8ghz, Nvidia GTX 560 Ti 448.

Filter settings:
- Gloss scale: 8
- Gloss bias: 1
- Mip count: 8
- Exclude base: false

Test case #1:
- Src face size: 256
- Dst face size: 256
- Lighting model: phongbrdf

Test case #2:
- Src face size: 256
- Dst face size: 256
- Lighting model: blinnbrdf

Test case #3:
- Src face size: 512
- Dst face size: 256
- Lighting model: phongbrdf

Test case #4:
- Src face size: 512
- Dst face size: 256
- Lighting model: blinnbrdf
